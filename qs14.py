#  Create a class named Notes for handling text-based file operations. Class should contain methods "write", "read" and then "append" 
#as instance  methods or class methods. (Can contain any other methods if you wish) Use a single file for saving the notes. 
#You can set the file name as a constant  somewhere in the program (Or as a class variable). write method should 
# create the if it doesn't exist, Then it should overwrite the older contents  with the user input if the user plans to overwrite the file.
# read method should read the whole file contents and return it. If the file doesn't exist, then it should return "No notes found" 
# append method should take the  user input value and it must add the value to the end of the file. It must not  overwrite the file.
# Now create a program to utilize this class. The program should repeatedly ask the user for these 4 choices :  
# 1 - Write Note (Overwrite existing).  
# 2 - Add more Notes (Append).  
# 3 - Read Notes.  
# 4 â€“ Exit
